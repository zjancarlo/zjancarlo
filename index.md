# Game Development

## Architecture Overview

Golden Hour uses the Unity game engine and is coded in C# with additional scripting via a Domain Specific Language built on top of the [Yarn Language](https://github.com/infiniteammoinc/Yarn).

A detailed breakdown of some of Golden Hour's major components can be found [here](/assets/Golden Hour System Architecture.pdf):

### [Golden Hour System Architecture](/assets/Golden Hour System Architecture.pdf)

## Tools Developed

Quick overview of some tools created to aid in the development of Golden Hour.

These tools were primarily developed to allow writers and artists to create assets such as scripts and sprites without needing technical knowledge.

### Yarn to Markdown

A Python script that converts the scripts for Golden Hour into a readable Markdown document for easy comparison and proofreading. Used as a git hook to ensure script correctness and automatically update the repository's copy of the equivalent Markdown document.

### Golden Hour Script Linter

A linter created in Python that renders the game's narrative state diagram and checks the writer produced scripts for errors. Also creates a list of assets referenced that still need to be created. Used as a git hook to ensure correctness and prevent errors from being committed.
